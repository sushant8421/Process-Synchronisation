Consider a system with 3-coffee lover processes and one agent process. Each coffee lover continuously makes
coffee and drinks. But to make coffee, the coffee lover needs 3 ingredients: coffee powder, sugar and milk. The
agent has indefinite supply of all the three ingredients required to make the coffee. One of the coffee lover has
coffee powder, another has sugar and the third has milk. The agent places two of the ingredients on the table.
The process who has the remaining ingredient, makes the coffee and drinks, signaling the agent on completion.
The agent then puts out another two of the three ingredients on the table and the cycle repeats.

Write a C program to code the agent and 3 coffee lovers as seperate processes. You shall achieve
synchronization between them through semaphores.

Task 1: Input the number of iterations "N" that is to be used for making coffee.
Task 2: The agent should randomly choose two of the three ingredients required to make the coffee.
Task 3: Determine the number of semaphores required to achieve perfect synchronization among the coffee
lovers. (Also, mention the reason in Readme file).
Task 4: For every iteration, print the ingredients that the agent placed on the table. Accordingly, print the coffee
lover who have successfully prepared his coffee.
